# CurlJson

Combines the Lean [Curl](https://reservoir.lean-lang.org/@bergmannjg/Curl)
binding and [Lean.Json](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Lean/Data/Json/Basic.html) to easily get json data from an URL.

Currently there is only one function `curlGetJson` which takes an URL.

## Example

See `example/` for simple usage.
